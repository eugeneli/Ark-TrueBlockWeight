# Ark-TrueBlockWeight

Ark’s Delegated Proof of Stake system encourages delegates to provide incentives to voters in the form of profit sharing from their forging rewards. In the current ecosystem, there is no way for the average non-technical delegate to get a forging node up and running with an accurate profit sharing distribution, as there is no existing public payout code that will exactly calculate rewards based on each individual voter’s staked ARK in the delegate pool. biz_classic has been developing a script that aims to address this issue whilst also allowing custom configurations on a per delegate basis, allowing for a diverse ecosystem of pools.

## Getting Started

You will need to be running a [full node](https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/ark-node) to have a copy of the blockchain to query.
Then modify ```config.json``` with your Ark Node's Postgresql database credentials and your delegate's public key.
```
{
    "user": "tbw",
    "host": "localhost",
    "database": "ark_mainnet",
    "password": "tbw",
    "port": 5432,
    "delegate": "Delegate Name"
}
```

If your pay script and node are not on the same server, you will need to configure the node's Postgresql database for external access.

##### Public Node
biz_classic offers a publicly accessible read-only ARK database for use with the True Block Weight script for delegates. Please reach out to one of us (either goldenpepe or moonman) on the ARK slack if you are a delegate who wishes to use the public node for your configuration.

### Installation and Usage
First, remember to configure your node's database as mentioned above and insert your credentials in ```config.json```
1) Clone this repository
2) ```cd Ark-TrueBlockWeight```
3) ```npm install```

#### Command line usage:
```node main.js start```

Optionally, you can pass in an arbitrary number of blocks:  ``` node main.js start 211```

### Include in a Nodejs project:
```
var TBW = require("../true_block_weight/main");
var options = {
    blacklist: {"someArkAddress": true, "otherArkAddress": true ...},
    blocks: 422, //Defaults to 211 if left empty
    blockShareFunc: (poolSize, voterBalanceAtblock) => { ... } //Function to be run when calculating each voter's share per block (Leave empty for 100% payouts, see examples below)
};
TBW.getPayouts(options).then((payData) => {
    console.log(payData);
});
```

```getPayouts(...)``` returns a promise that resolves with the following object:
```
var payData = {
    taxes: taxes, //The delegate owner's cut
    payouts: payouts // { "someArkAddress": (BigNumber.js object with their total share across all blocks), "otherArkAddress": (BigNumber.js object) ...}
};
```

### Example block share functions
Pay 100% of forged blocks (default if ```options.blockShareFunc``` is empty)
```
var blockShareFunc = (poolSize, voterBalance) => {
    var forgedBalance = new BigNumber(2);       //Block reward
    var poolSize = new BigNumber(poolSize);     //Total pool size
    var balance = new BigNumber(voterBalance);  //Balance of voter at each block

    var fullPay = forgedBalance.times(balance).dividedBy(poolSize); //This voter's share of the 2 Ark block reward

    //Return an array of two BigNumber.js objects, [voter's share, delegate's cut]
    return [fullPay, new BigNumber(0)]; 
};
```

Pay 90% of forged block rewards if the voter's balance is less than 100,000 Ark and 50% if the voter's balance is over 100,000 Ark
```
var blockShareFunc = (poolSize, voterBalance) => {
    var forgedBalance = new BigNumber(2);       //Block reward
    var poolSize = new BigNumber(poolSize);     //Total pool size
    var balance = new BigNumber(voterBalance);  //Balance of voter at each block
    
    var fullPay = forgedBalance.times(balance).dividedBy(poolSize);
    var pay, tax;
    var whaleLimit = 100000 * 100000000;        //Convert to Arktoshis
    if(balance.lessThan(whaleLimit))
    {
        pay = fullPay.times(0.9);
        tax = fullPay.times(0.1);
    }
    else
    {
        pay = fullPay.times(0.5);
        tax = fullPay.times(0.5);
    }

    //Return an array of two BigNumber.js objects, [voter's share, delegate's cut]
    return [pay, tax]; 
};
```
